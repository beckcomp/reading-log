Chapter 1 - The Foundations of Biochemistry
  1.1 Cellular Foundations
    - Cells Are the Structural and Functional Units of All Living Organisms
    - Cellular Dimensions Are Limited by Oxygen Diffusion
    - There are Three Distinct Domains of Life
    - Escherichia coli Is the Most-Studied Prokaryotic Cell
    - Eukaryotic Cells Have a Variety of Membranous Organelles, Which Can Be Isolated for Study
    - The Cytoplasm Is Organized by the Cytoskeleton and Is Highly Dynamic
    - Cells Build Supramolecular Structures
    - In Vitro Studies May Overlook Important Interactions among Molecules
    - Summary 1.1 Cellular Foundations
  1.2 Chemical Foundations
    - Biomolecules Are Compounds of Carbon wiht a Variety of Functional Groups
    - Cells Contain a Universal Set of Small Molecules
    - Macromolecules Are the Major Constituents of Cells
