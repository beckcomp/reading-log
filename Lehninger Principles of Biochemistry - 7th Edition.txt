Chapter 1 - The Foundations of Biochemistry
  1.1 Cellular Foundations
    - Cells Are the Structural and Functional Units of All Living Organisms
    - Cellular Dimensions Are Limited by Oxygen Diffusion
    - There are Three Distinct Domains of Life
    - Escherichia coli Is the Most-Studied Prokaryotic Cell
    - Eukaryotic Cells Have a Variety of Membranous Organelles, Which Can Be Isolated for Study
    - The Cytoplasm Is Organized by the Cytoskeleton and Is Highly Dynamic
    - Cells Build Supramolecular Structures
    - In Vitro Studies May Overlook Important Interactions among Molecules
    - Summary 1.1 Cellular Foundations
  1.2 Chemical Foundations
    - Biomolecules Are Compounds of Carbon wiht a Variety of Functional Groups
    - Cells Contain a Universal Set of Small Molecules
    - Macromolecules Are the Major Constituents of Cells
    - Three-Dimensional Structure Is Described by Configuration and Conformation
    - Interactions between Biomolecules Are Stereospecific
    - Summary 1.2 Chemical Foundations
  1.3 Physical Foundations
    - Living Organisms Exist in a Dynamic Steady State, Never at Equilibrium with Their Surroundings
    - Organisms Transform Energy and Matter from Their Surroundings
    - The Flow of Electrons Provides Energy for Organisms
    - Creating and Maintaining Order Requires Work and Energy
    - Energy Coupling Links Reactions in Biology
    - K_eq and ΔG° Are Measures of a Reaction's Tendency to Proceed Spontaneously
    - Enzymes Promote Sequences of Chemical Reactions
    - Metabolism Is Regulated to Achieve Balance and Economy
    - Summary 1.3 Physical Foundations
  1.4 Genetic Foundations
    - Genetic Continuity Is Vested in Single DNA Molecules
    - The Structure of DNA Allows for Its Replication and Repair with Near-Perfect Fidelity
    - The Linear Sequence in DNA Encodes Proteins with Three-Dimensional Structures
    - Summary 1.4 Genetic Foundations
  1.5 Evolutionary Foundations
    - Changes in the Hereditary Instructions Allow Evolution
    - Biomolecules First Arose by Chemical Evolution
    - Chemical Evolution Can Be Simulated in the Laboratory
    - RNA or Related Precursor May Have Been the First Genes and Catalysts
    - Biological Evolution Began More Than Three and a Half Billion Years Ago
    - The First Cell Was Probably a Chemoheterotroph
    - Eukaryotic Cells Evolved from Prokaryotes in Several Stages
    - Molecular Anatomy Reveals Evolutionary Relationships
    - Functional Genomics Shows the Allocations of Genes to Specific Cellular Processes
    - Genomic Comparisons Will Have Increasing Importance in Human Biology and Medicine
    - Summary 1.5 Evolutionary Foundations
